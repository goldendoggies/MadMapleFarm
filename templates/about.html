              <p>August ‘Gus’ Torsilieri began riding at his family farm at a young
              age. Growing up to a non “horsey” family he began his education
              with the US Pony club. After attaining his A rating he began a
              tutelage with Jean Paul Murat.
              <p>

              </p>
              After opening his own stables at 18, August focused on retraining
              problem horses and breaking in young stock. Over the
              years August grew his business, Torsilieri Show Stables, to a 30+
              horse training business in Pittstown NJ.
              Throughout his career he has learned and been mentored by top
              professionals such as Devin Ryan, Nona Garson, Anne Kursinski
              and Stephan Cheret.
              <p>

              </p>
              August’s personal riding career has taken him to the FEI 3* levels
              on Samy du Reverdy, breaking into the top 100 on the Rolex
              Ranking list, winning numerous grand prix classes and open
              ranking classes. Young horse production has always been a
              passion of August’s and has produced many young horses to the
              national finals and developed and sold them on to great results.
              In addition, his students have been seen in the high amateur
              classes, U25 classes and junior jumper ranks.
            <p>

            </p>
              When not riding and training, August enjoys cooking, golf and
              mowing his yard.

            <p class="card-text">
              <p>Alex started loving horses when she was 7. She began at a
              riding school near her childhood home in Phoenixville PA. She
              and her best friend grew up riding around the golf course across
              the street and running through trails and corn fields.
              </p>
              <p>
              Alex began her formal training as a rider with Dawn Corrado at
              Valley Hill Farm in Chester Springs PA. She found her very first
              horse, a 5 year old Thoroughbred named Kodak Moment. That
              was the beginning of Alex’s love and respect of the thoroughbred
              breed.
              </p>
              <p>
              During and after College, Alex worked for and rode for Frank,
              Mary, and Laura Chapot in Neshanic Station, NJ. It was this
              fortunate opportunity that took Alex to all the major shows along
              the east coast. It was also here that Alex developed an
              appreciation for young horses and training.
              </p>
              <p>
              12 years later, Alex decided to start her own business. Veritas
              Farms had a myriad of students and horses, some of whom are
              still with Alex to this day. She has since jumped many Grand
              Prixs and just ventured into the International Derbies.
